# volentunes
VolenTunes was created during the Hip Hop Hactivist hackathon hosted at Tumblr. The concept for the app was created by a team of 
highschoolers and executed by a small team of designers and Android developers. The concept behind the app is to encourage 
people to volunteer by making it easy for them to locate opportunities to do so in NY while also getting rewarded for their
participation. 
The user first saves their music and volunteer preferences, is then led to a list of opportunities from which they can pick/sign up.
After completing the volunteer work they are given a code which gives them a lyric, which is a sort of currency to redeem prizes.
After getting enough lyrics for a full song users can then redeem them for concert tickets.
